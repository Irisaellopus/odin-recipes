    <h2><em>Filipino-style chicken adobo</em></h2>

    <p>Adobo is derived from the spanish word <em>adobar</em>, meaning <strong>marinade</strong>. 
    The practice of marinating meat in a flavorful misture made from vinegar, salt, garlic, paprika, and oregano
    was common to Spanish cooking.</p>
    <p>Spanish colonists gave the name “adobo” to the cooking method indigenous to the Philippines, as their
    marinades were so similar. Today, Spanish adobo typically refers to the sauce, an intensely flavored and red,
    due to the paprika,containing chipotle chiles that have been stewed in the basic adobo marinade mixture.</p>
